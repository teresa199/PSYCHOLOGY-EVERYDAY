		A PART OF PHILISOPHY<br>
		<pr>Earlier psychology was considered as apart of philosophy and so many philosophers like Plato, Aristotle ,Thales etc.described it in different ways.
		Aristotle, building upon the work of the earlier philosophers and their studies into mind, reasoning and thought, wrote the first known text in the history of psychology,called Para Psyche, 'About the Mind'.<br>
		Plato's tripartite theory of the soul.Plato said even after death soul exist and it is able to think.<br>
		The Platonic soul consists of three parts which are located in different regions of the body:-<br>
        the logos i.e located in the head, is related to reason and regulates the other parts.<br>
        the thymos i.e located near the chest region and is related to anger<br>
        the eros i.e located in the stomach and is related to one's desires.<br>
        Even in India there were contributions from the part of Buddhists.Medieval Muslim physicians also developed practices to treat patients suffering from a variety of "diseases of the mind".Like for example Al-Balkhi who recognized that the body and the soul can be healthy or sick, or "balanced or imbalanced". He wrote that imbalance of the body can result in fever, headaches and other bodily illnesses, while imbalance of the soul can result in anger, anxiety, sadness and other psyche-related symptoms.

		THE FIRST LAB<br>
		 <img src="lab 3.jpg" width="300px;"> In 1879, at the University of Leipzig, Wundt opened the first laboratory ever to be exclusively devoted to psychological studies, and this event marked the official birth of psychology as an independent field of study. The new lab was full of graduate students carrying out research on topics assigned by Wundt, and it soon attracted young scholars from all over the world who were eager to learn about development in the fiels of psychology.The number of his assistants grew to 15 later.<br>

        WILHELM WUNDT<br>
        Wundt is considered to be an important figure as he separated psychology from philosophy by analyzing the structure of mind. Therefore his school of thought is known as Structuralism which is also considered as the early view of psychology.His concept was somewhat related to science as it dealt with the exploration of mind.<br>
